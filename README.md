# Expense Tracker
This is our software engineering final project 
for Mr.Gangoo
we made an Expense Tracker which records your income and expenses
this project is under BPMS architecture
 and coded using functional programming.
# How it works 
To use this expense Tracker you enter the title and the amount 
postive numbers register as income and negative numbers as expense
you can hover over the the registered transactions and delete them 
every transaction will change your balance
# Technologies 
We used HTML/CSS  and vanila JS for this project. 
we initally wanted to use React JS and Context API but we needed to create a database and according to the size of project we thought it's a lot of work so we use vanila HTML/CSS/JS and used local storage to save data
